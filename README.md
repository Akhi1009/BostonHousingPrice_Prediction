# BostonHousingPrice_Prediction
Developing a Machine Learning model to predict Boston Housing Price

# Overview
This project focuses on predicting housing prices in the Boston area using various machine learning algorithms. The dataset contains information about different housing characteristics, and the goal is to develop a predictive model that can accurately forecast housing prices based on these features.

# Project Objectives
Provide insights and visualizations to explore the Boston housing prices dataset.
Clean and preprocess the dataset to ensure high-quality data for modeling.
Apply multiple regression models, including traditional and machine learning techniques, to predict housing prices.
Evaluate and compare the performance of each model using key metrics.
Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Boston Housing Prices dataset, which contains 506 instances and 13 features related to housing in various neighborhoods of Boston.

# Models Used
The project implements and compares the following regression algorithms:
Linear Regression
Random Forest Regressor
Support Vector Regressor

# Evaluation Metrics
To assess the performance of each model, the following metrics will be used:
Mean Squared Error (MSE)
R-squared (RÂ²)

# Key Steps
Data Exploration & Visualization: Visualizing data distributions, feature correlations, and outliers.
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values
Model Training: Training multiple regression models on the cleaned dataset.
Model Evaluation: Comparing the performance of different models to identify the best predictor of housing prices.
